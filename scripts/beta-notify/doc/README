Roundup devel tracker in love with subversion
=============================================

This document serves a tutorial on setting up a Roundup instance
with devel template featuring subversion integration. Several assumptions
are made in this tutorial:

1) You've checked out gsoc-2009 Roundup branch
2) You know how to setup subversion repository
3) You want to work with a local subversion repository

Let's follow the steps:

1) Setup subversion post-commit hook

a) Rename post-commit.tmpl to post-commit
b) Make sure its executable (chmod +x)
c) Add the following to it:

PYTHON=/usr/bin/python
NOTIFY=/path/to/notify-roundup.py[1]
CONFIG=/path/to/notify-roundup.ini[1]
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/roundup/instance "$PYTHON" "$NOTIFY" "$CONFIG" "$REPOS" "$REV"

[1] notify-roundup.py and notify-roundup.ini can be found in scripts/notify-roundup

2) Modify notify-roundup.ini

a) Set tracker home: tracker-home = /path/to/tracker-home
b) Set address mappings

3) Copy html templates from scripts/notify-roundup/html to share/roundup/templates/devel/html

4) Copy revision_info.py extension from scripts/notify-roundup/extensions to share/roundup/templates/devel/extensions

5) Now, now, this wasn't so hard :)

How-to format subversion commit message
=======================================

By default, notify-roundup handles bugs.
To change status of bug1, format your commit
message like this:

bug1 pending

Current limitations
===================

1) Notify-roundup can work only with one item-class
2) Notify-roundup can only modify Status

We are aware of the those limitations, and have plans to alleviate them in the future.
