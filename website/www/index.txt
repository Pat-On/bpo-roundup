Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. 
It is based on the winning design from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

The current stable version of Roundup is 1.4.x which has quite a comprehensive 
:doc:`feature set <docs/features>`. For more information see the :doc:`design overview <docs/design>`,
and all the other :doc:`documentation <docs>`. Roundup has been deployed for:

    * bug tracking and TODO list management (the classic installation)
    * customer help desk support (with a wizard for the phone answerers, linking to networking, 
      system and development issue trackers)
    * issue management for IETF working groups
    * sales lead tracking
    * conference paper submission and double-blind referee management
    * weblogging (well, almost :) 

...and so on. It's been designed with :doc:`flexibility <docs/customizing>` in mind - it's not just 
another bug tracker. Roundup ships with a *demo tracker* to play with - after you've unpacked the source, 
just run "python demo.py" and load up the URL it prints out!

Roundup was originally released as version 0.1.1 in late August, 2001. The first `change note`_ I wrote says:

    Needed a bug tracking system. Looked around. Tried to install many Perl-based systems, to no avail.
    Got tired of waiting for Roundup to be released. Had just finished major product project, so needed
    something different for a while. Roundup here I come... 

So I've been working on this thing for over seven years. Do you like Roundup? 
Want to say thanks? You can just send me a note (I always appreciate them) or better yet, `send me a gift`_ :)
