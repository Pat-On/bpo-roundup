These are the sources of the Roundup website. 
To build them, you need Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).

  pip install sphinx
  pip install sphinxcontrib-cheeseshop

The content of the 'docs' section are mirrored in from the roundup package
- typically just a symlink of "docs" from the roundup source.

Good luck !
