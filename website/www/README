These are the sources of the Roundup website. 
To build them, you need Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).

The content of the 'docs' section are mirrored in from the roundup package,
so make sure you have created a 'docs/' directory with the right files in it
(see 'docs.rst') from the last roundup release.

Good luck !
