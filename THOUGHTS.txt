New Improved Structure
======================

instance_home:

   config.rc
      -- add in the database backend selection

   schema.???   xml???
      -- replaces dbinit.open()
      -- TODO: what to do about dbinit.init()

   database.py
      -- defines any additional classes used in the schema

   detectors
      -- as it currently stands, but have the nosy reactor be a single call
         to core nosy reactor code so upgrades aren't a pain

   db
      -- as it currently stands

   html
      -- keep, but be able to default back to the installation share dir
         for missing files ... and then don't install any

   dbinit.py, interfaces.py, __init__.py
      -- go the way of the Dodo


roundup.instance.open()
   Would now return a class instance that handles all the icky instance
   stuff.
   ... like, oh, getting a handle to the damn config!
